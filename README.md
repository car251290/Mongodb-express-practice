# Mongodb-express-practice
practices with node.js express.js and Mongoose 

this project help to get a response from a server and (get post update delate )
if we want to get data we will write get data 
if we want to post we write post data 
and the update for get updates of the data 
to get update data
and delate the data.

and how to build a good code!! in Back End.

## Mongodb
MongoDB Atlas also includes powerful features to enhance reliability for your mission-critical production databases, such as continuous backups and point-in-time recovery.
MongoDB Atlas makes it easy to control access to your database. Your database instances are deployed in a unique Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure network isolation.

To install Mongobd

## The Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture
The most popular software architecture, by far, is the Model View Controller.

Model View Controller divides any large application into three parts:

The Model
The View
The Controller

## Moongese
help to undertsand the list of object use it this practice and the way to request database
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html

## Practice and connect to Mongodb
use Robo 3t the link :3T will continue development of Robo 3T in parallel with its own MongoDB GUI and the good news is that it will be making Robo 3T free

## Route
You can add middleware and HTTP method routes (such as get, put, post, and so on) to router just like an application.
A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.

For more information, see Router.

# First be sure you have MongoDB and Node.js installed.

## Tools
Visual Studio
Express
Mongoose
Node.js
PostMan (localhost response and object array)
Robo 3t (test in the Mongoosee)
